#Jasmine Testing for Backbone.js Models and Views

Behavior-driven development with Jasmine testing enables developers to create thoughtful software design. Testing helps us match code to expectation, and communicates our intentions to other developers. When coupled with Backbone.js, Jasmine can become a powerful tool in ensuring the scalability of our web application. In addition, testing on Views in the browser helps us find bugs before the effort of visual QA.

This session will cover a breakdown of how to approach Jasmine testing for Backbone.js Models and Views, how Jasmine testing works with instantiating new Models and Views, and how to trigger and test custom events and their callbacks.
